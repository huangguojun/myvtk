### Description
This example displays a red "Hello" in 3D space. For an example where the text always faces the camera, see [Follower](/Cxx/Visualization/Follower).

If you want to draw text in 2D rather than 3D, take a look at [TextWidget](/Cxx/Widgets/TextWidget) or [DrawText](/Cxx/Visualization/DrawText).
