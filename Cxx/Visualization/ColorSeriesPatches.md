### Description

This example shows how to produce a HTML page called [VTKColorSeriesPatches](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/lorensen/VTKExamples/blob/master/src/Python/Visualization/VTKColorSeriesPatches.html) showing the available colors series in vtkColorSeries.

It also shows how to select the text color based on luminance. In this case, Digital CCIR601 is used, which gives less weight to the red and blue components of a color.
