### Description
An [(file format)|STL file]]([wikipedia:STL) describes a triangulated three-dimensional surface by the unit normal and vertices (ordered by the right-hand rule) of the triangles. This example saves a 3D geometric data stored in a {{class|vtkPolyData}} to an STL file using {{class|vtkSTLWriter}}.
