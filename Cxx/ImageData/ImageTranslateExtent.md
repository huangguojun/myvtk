### Description
If you are looking to change the extent to change the "origin" of the image from the corner to the center, see vtkImageChangeInformation (http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Images/CenterAnImage).

Currently this method changes the extent (shown by the terminal output in the example), but does not change where the corner of the image is displayed relative to the sphere at (0,0,0).
