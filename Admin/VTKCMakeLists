###Download and Build XXX

Click [here to download XXX](https://github.com/lorensen/VTKWikiExamplesTarballs/raw/master/XXX.tar) and its *CMakeLists.txt* file.
Once the *tarball XXX.tar* has been downloaded and extracted,
```
cd XXX/build 
```
If VTK is installed:
```
cmake ..
```
If VTK is not installed but compiled on your system, you will need to specify the path to your VTK build:
```
cmake -DVTK_DIR:PATH=/home/me/vtk_build ..
```
Build the project:
```
make
```
and run it:
```
./XXX
```

!!! note "WINDOWS USERS"
    Be sure to add the VTK bin directory to your path. This will resolve the VTK dll's at run time.
